Title: Calculate Similarity and Distance Metrics for Excel Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: WU KEZHAO
Maintainer: WU KEZHAO <wilsonkwu@gmail.com>
Description: A package designed to process numerical data from Excel files, 
    allowing users to calculate both Euclidean distances and cosine 
    similarity between groups of data. It reads data from Excel files, 
    standardizes the values by column, and calculates the Euclidean 
    distance and cosine similarity between rows (groups). The results 
    are sorted and provided in a convenient format. This package also 
    checks for non-numeric data and provides user-friendly warnings if 
    non-numeric content is detected, ensuring the input data is fully 
    numeric before analysis.
